    """An interface for objects that represent columns in a relation.

    Notes
    -----
    Relations intentionally do not support column renaming, and instead expect
    to be used along with a `ColumnTag` class (or set of classes) whose
    instances can represent all columns in all tables in an absolute sense: if
    a column in one table is equal to a column in some other table, they are
    expected to mean the same thing in several ways:

    - equal values for that columns is automatically included as as constraint
      when those relations are joined, and which of those columns is "used" as
      the join's own column with that tag is unspecified and unimportant;
    - relations may only be unioned together if they have the same columns;
    - `Predicate`, `OrderByTerm`, and `JoinCondition` objects depend only on
      sets of columns, and do not care which relations actually provide those
      columns.

    It is not required that any particular engine use a `ColumnTag` or its
    `str` form as its own internal name, though this often convenient.  For
    example, the provided `sql` engine allows `Leaf` relations (which are
    usually tables) to have arbitrary column names, but it uses the `ColumnTag`
    `str` form for names in all SELECT queries that represent operations on
    those tables.

    Hashable builtins such as `str` or `tuple` may be used directly as column
    tags in simple cases, but it is expected that in most scenarios custom
    named tuples or frozen dataclasses will be used instead, and some engines
    or extension operations may require more of the column tag type than is
    defined here.

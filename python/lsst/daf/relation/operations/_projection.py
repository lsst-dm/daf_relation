    ----------
    base : `Relation`
        Relation this operation acts upon.
    columns : `frozenset` [ `ColumnTag` ]
        Columns to propagate.

    Notes
    -----
    Like other operations, `Projection` objects should only be constructed
    directly by code that can easily guarantee their `checked_and_simplify`
    invariants; in all other contexts, the `Relation.projection` factory should
    be used instead.

    See `Relation.projection` for the `checked_and_simplified` behavior for
    this class.

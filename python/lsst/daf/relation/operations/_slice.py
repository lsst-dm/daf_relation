    """An operation `.Relation` that sorts and/or filters rows positionally.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base : `.Relation`
        Relation this operation acts upon.
    order_by : `tuple` [ `.OrderByTerm`, ... ]
        Criteria for sorting rows.
    offset : `int`
        Starting index (from 0) for the rows included.
    limit : `int` or `None`
        Maximum number of rows returned, or `None` for no limit.

    Notes
    -----
    Like other operations, `Slice` objects should only be constructed directly
    by code that can easily guarantee their `checked_and_simplified`
    invariants; in all other contexts, the `.Relation.slice` factory should be
    used instead.

    See `.Relation.slice` for the `checked_and_simplified` behavior for this
    class.

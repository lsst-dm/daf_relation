    Parameters
    ----------
    base : `.Relation`
        Relation this operation acts upon, in the source engine.
    destination : `.EngineTag`
        Engine to transfer the relation to.

    Notes
    -----
    Like other operations, `Transfer` objects should only be constructed
    directly by code that can easily guarantee their `checked_and_simplified`
    invariants; in all other contexts, the `.Relation.transfer` factory should
    be used instead.

    See `.Relation.transfer` for the `checked_and_simplified` behavior for this
    class.

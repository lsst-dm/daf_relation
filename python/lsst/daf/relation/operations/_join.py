class Join(Relation[_T]):
    """An operation `.Relation` that performs a natural join.

    A natural join includes all columns from all input relations while keeping
    only rows where all input relations have the same values for any common
    columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    engine : `.EngineTag`
        Engine the join is performed in.  This must be the same as the engine
        of all input relations.
    relations : `tuple` [ `.Relation` , ... ]
        Input relations for the join.
    conditions : `frozenset` [ `.JoinCondition` ]
        Custom (generally non-equality) conditions on which to join pairs of
        relations.

    Notes
    -----
    Like other operations, `Join` objects should only be constructed directly
    by code that can easily guarantee their `checked_and_simplified`
    invariants; in all other contexts, the `.Relation.join` factory should be
    used instead.

    Join objects with no relations are permitted (with no conditions, either),
    and are used to represent the "unit relation" (see `.Relation.make_unit`),
    though these are often simplified out after they are added to larger
    relation trees.  Join objects with one relation are not permitted; these
    should always be simplified out as a no-op.  Some relations may prohibit
    joins with more than two relations (see
    `EngineOptions.pairwise_joins_only`).

    See `.Relation.join` for the `checked_and_simplified` behavior for this
    class.

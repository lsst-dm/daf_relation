class Union(Relation[_T]):
    """An operation `.Relation` that combines the rows of its input relations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    engine : `.EngineTag`
        Engine the union is performed in.  This must be the same as the engine
        of all input relations.
    columns : `~collections.abc.Set` [ `.ColumnTag` ]
        Set of columns for this relation; all input relations must have the
        same columns already.
    relations : `tuple` [ `.Relation` , ... ]
        Input relations to combine.
    unique_keys : `~collections.abc.Set` [ `.UniqueKey` ]
        Set of sets that represent multi-column unique constraints that will be
        *naturally* satisfied by this union, even if the engine does not take
        any extra action to remove duplicates.  If not provided or empty, the
        returned relation does not guarantee uniqueness.

    Notes
    -----
    Like other operations, `Union` objects should only be constructed directly
    by code that can easily guarantee their `checked_and_simplified`
    invariants; in all other contexts, the `.Relation.union` factory should be
    used instead.

    Union objects with no relations are permitted (with no conditions, either),
    and are used to represent the "unit relation" (see `.Relation.make_zero`),
    though these are often simplified out after they are added to larger
    relation trees.  Union objects with one relation are not permitted; these
    should always be simplified out as a no-op.  Some relations may prohibit
    unions with more than two relations (see
    `EngineOptions.pairwise_unions_only`).

    This union operation corresponds SQL's ``UNION ALL``, because it does not
    force unique rows in the result (at most it can be told when unique rows
    naturally occur).  Use ``union(...).distinct(...)`` for an operation that
    maps to SQL's ``UNION``.

    See `.Relation.union` for the `checked_and_simplified` behavior for this
    class.

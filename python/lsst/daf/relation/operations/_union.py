class Union(Relation[_T]):
    """An operation `.Relation` that combines the rows of its input relations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    engine : `.EngineTag`
        Engine the join is performed in.  This must be the same as the engine
        of all input relations.
    columns : `~collections.abc.Set` [ `.ColumnTag` ]
        Set of columns for this relation; all input relations must have the
        same columns already.
    relations : `tuple` [ `.Relation` , ... ]
        Input relations to combine.
    unique_keys : `~collections.abc.Set` [ `.UniqueKey` ]
        Set of sets that represent multi-column unique constraints that will be
        *naturally* satisfied by this union, even if the engine does not take
        any extra action to remove duplicates.  If not provided or empty, the
        returned relation does not guarantee uniqueness.
    extra_doomed_by : `frozenset` [ `str` ]
        Diagnostic messages that can be used to report why the relation has no
        rows when that is the case.  This should generally be provided when
        there are no relations.  When there are other relations, it is only
        used as (part of) the `doomed_by` property when those relations also
        yield no rows.

    Notes
    -----
    Like other operations, `Union` objects should only be constructed directly
    by code that can easily guarantee their `checked_and_simplified`
    invariants; in all other contexts, the `.Relation.union` factory should be
    used instead.

    Union objects with no relations are permitted (with no conditions, either),
    and are used to represent the "unit relation" (see `.Relation.make_zero`),
    though these are often simplified out after they are added to larger
    relation trees.  Union objects with one relation are not permitted; these
    should always be simplified out as a no-op.  Some relations may prohibit
    unions with more than two relations (see
    `EngineOptions.pairwise_unions_only`).

    This union operation corresponds SQL's ``UNION ALL``, because it does not
    force unique rows in the result (at most it can be told when unique rows
    naturally occur).  Use ``union(...).distinct(...)`` for an operation that
    maps to SQL's ``UNION``.

    See `.Relation.union` for the `checked_and_simplified` behavior for this
    class.

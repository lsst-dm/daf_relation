    Parameters
    ----------
    base_rows : `RowIterable`
        The first iterable being joined.  This iterable's order will be
        preserved and it will always be iterated over lazily (rather than
        copied into an in-memory container), but it is not given an opportunity
        to specialize the join behavior via `RowIterable.try_join`.
    next_rows : `RowIterable`
        The second iterable being joined.  This iterable's order will not
        necessarily be preserved and it may be copied into an in-memory
        container in order to construct an index mapping to perform a
        hash join.  It is given an opportunity to specialize the join behavior
        first via a call to `RowIterable.try_join`.
    base_relation : `.Relation`
        Relation corresponding to ``base_rows``.
    next_relation : `.Relation`
        Relation corresponding to ``next_rows``.
    conditions : `~collections.abc.Set` [ `.JoinCondition` ]
        Special join conditions to apply.  Any not handled by
        `RowIterable.try_join` will be applied as if they were predicates, i.e.
        by filtering rows after they have already been joined on any common
        columns between the rows.

    Returns
    -------
    join_rows : `RowIterable`
        New iterable that implements the join operation.

        Engine tag for the join.  This must always be the native iteration

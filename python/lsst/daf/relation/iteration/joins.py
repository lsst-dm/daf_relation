    Parameters
    ----------
    lhs_rows : `RowIterable`
        The first iterable being joined.  This iterable's order will be
        preserved and it will always be iterated over lazily (rather than
        copied into an in-memory container), but it is not given an opportunity
        to specialize the join behavior via `RowIterable.try_join`.
    rhs_rows : `RowIterable`
        The second iterable being joined.  This iterable's order will not
        necessarily be preserved and it may be copied into an in-memory
        container in order to construct an index mapping to perform a hash
        join.  It is given an opportunity to specialize the join behavior first
        via a call to `RowIterable.try_join`.
    lhs_relation : `.Relation`
        Relation corresponding to ``lhs_rows``.
    rhs_relation : `.Relation`
        Relation corresponding to ``rhs_rows``.
    condition : `.JoinCondition` or None
        Special join condition to apply.  If not handled by
        `RowIterable.try_join` this will be applied as if it was a predicates,
        i.e.  by filtering rows after they have already been joined on any
        common columns between the rows.  Expected to already be flipped if
        needed to match the ``(lhs, rhs)`` order.

    Returns
    -------
    join_rows : `RowIterable`
        New iterable that implements the join operation.

        Engine tag for the join.  This must always be the native iteration
        engine, but it's easier to pass it into this (private) function from
        the relation than import the singleton directly, since that would

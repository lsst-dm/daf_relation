    Notes
    -----
    The "engines" used to evaluate relation trees do not have a common
    interface, because they all do different things.  This class defines what
    they must have in common: a hashable, equality-comparable class (preferably
    lightweight with a concise `str` representation) used to identify the
    engine in relations and the various helper objects that are also part of a
    relation tree (`Predicate`, `JoinCondition`, `OrderByTerm`).

    It is recommended that an engine's tag class also serve as the primary
    entry point for its most important operations.

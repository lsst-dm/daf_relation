class Relation(Generic[_T]):
    """An abstract interface for conceptual sets of tuples.

    Relation is generic over the type used to represent its columns; see
    `.ColumnTag` for more information.

    Notes
    -----
    `Relation` is an unusual abstract base class in that inheritance from it is
    closed to the `Leaf` class (and its subclasses) the types in the
    `operations` subpackage, and subclasses of the `Extension` class; while
    other external derived classes are not explicitly prohibited (there's no
    graceful way to do that in Python), much of the functionality of this
    package relies on the set of derived types enumerated in the
    `RelationVisitor` interface.  Essentially, instead of the types of
    relations in a tree being arbitrarily extensible, this package treats
    things one can *do* with a relation tree as its primary extension
    interface.

    **Relation construction**

    The `Relation` base class provides factory methods that should generally be
    used to construct derived instances (instead of the class constructors).
    These factories perform checking and simplification that can't be always
    be done in constructors, because they can change the type of the operation
    returned.  The `checked_and_simplified` and `assert_checked_and_simplified`
    methods can be used instead to ensure the invariants of derived types are
    satisfied, and can recursively check and simplify a relation tree.  The
    factory methods on the `Relation` base class do not check and simplify
    recursively; they assume any given operations are already checked and
    simplified.

    Relations should never be modified after construction.

    **String formatting**

    Relations define `repr` to provide a complete (deserializable via
    `serialization.MappingReader`) string representation, and `str` to provide
    a compact but lossy string representation.  The latter should always be
    used in error messages.

        Notes
        -----
        Ordering and slicing are combined into a single operation because
        strict relational algebra does not involve ordered rows at all, and
        without a sort order positional slicing is of relatively little use
        (with "are there at least N rows" tests a notable exception).  Engines
        are permitted to not support sorting at all (`EngineOptions.can_sort`),
        and are generally not expected to propagate sort order through other
        operations.

        Engines may also provide ways to evaluate relations while sorting
        and/or slicing the final result, without actually representing those
        operations as a relation, which is usually preferable when supported.
        The provided `sql` engine does this.  The provided native `iteration`
        engine does not, but since its final result is just a Python collection
        of mappings, Python builtins like `sorted` and sequence slicing can be
        used instead.

        """Check and simplify this relation, returning one that satisfies both
        the relation derived type's invariants and those of its engine.

        Parameters
        ----------
        recursive : `bool`, optional
            If `True`, descend into nested relations to check and simplify them
            as well.

        Returns
        -------
        relation : `Relation`
            Relation that satisfies all invariants and combines most
            back-to-back operations of the same type into single equivalent
            operations.  Guaranteed to be ``self`` (not just a relation
            equivalent to self) when no simplification is performed).

        Raises
        ------
        ColumnError
            Raised when relation operations are inconsistent in ways that
            involve their columns and/or unique keys.  See the `Relation`
            class factory methods for details.
        RelationalAlgebraError
            Raised when relation operations are inconsistent in ways that do
            not involve their columns and/or unique keys.  See the `Relation`
            class factory methods for details.
        EngineError
            Raised when engines are inconsistent or operations are define in a
            way an engine does not support.
